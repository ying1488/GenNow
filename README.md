GenNow
GenNow is an application designed to aid policymakers in developing strategies to enhance youth engagement in post-secondary education. This project concentrated on identifying some risk factors that hinder youth participation in post-school studies. For a detailed case study utilizing Australian census data, please refer to the accompanying data story.

AI Model Training Objective

Our aim in training an AI model is to:


Identify census data based on postal codes.

Analyze this data using a risk ruler to assess various financial factors.

Consolidate all risk ruler scores to determine a comprehensive rating.

Interpret these ratings to gauge the urgency of implementing community support measures.

Future Model Applications

In the future, this model could potentially:



Generate tailored recommendations and support interventions.

Leverage news, statistical trends, and additional datasets (e.g., educational institution data, employment records, social media) to address identified risks and improve community outcomes.
