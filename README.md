GenNow


GenNow is an application designed to aid policymakers in developing strategies to enhance youth engagement in post-secondary education. This project concentrated on identifying some risk factors that hinder youth participation in post-school studies. For a detailed case study utilizing Australian census data, please refer to the accompanying data story.

AI Model Training Objective

Our aim in training an AI model is to:


Identify census data based on postal codes.
![AIModel1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/764e3d91-b2af-4439-afb6-24a28ec3e3aa)

Analyze this data using a risk ruler to assess various financial factors.

Consolidate all risk ruler scores to determine a comprehensive rating.

Interpret these ratings to gauge the urgency of implementing community support measures.

Future Model Applications

In the future, this model could potentially:

Generate tailored recommendations and support interventions.

Leverage news, statistical trends, and additional datasets (e.g., educational institution data, employment records, social media) to address identified risks and improve community outcomes.


Data Story

The Rise of Engagement in youth

Introduction: A surprising statistic in youth engagement and risk factor

Problem: The challenge of identifying risk factors stopping youth from engaging in post school studies.

![DataStory](https://github.com/ying1488/GenNow/blob/main/Images/DataStory.png)


Data from : Australian Bureau of Statistics (2021)

Data shows that : Community with lower household income will have lesser percentage of the population engaging in post school studies.

Insights: By identifying the lower weekly household income leading to a lesser percentage of the population engaging in post school studies, this is one of the risk factor lowering the engagement of engaging in post school studies.
In the AI model , weekly income will be graded based on the median weekly household income of Australia giving it a score following guidelines of the risk ruler.
With the sum of all the other risk factor in play, this community will attain a rating with a call of actions for policy makers to prioritise actions to minimise the level of risk in the community.

Conclusion: A call to action for policymakers to use GenNow to identify risk factor, implementing measures to improve the outcome of engagement for a particular community.
