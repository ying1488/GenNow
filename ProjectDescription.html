    <h1>GenNow</h1>

    <p>GenNow is an application designed to aid policymakers in developing strategies to enhance youth engagement in post-secondary education. This project concentrated on identifying some risk factors that hinder youth participation in post-school studies. For a detailed case study utilizing Australian census data, please refer to the accompanying data story. </p>

    <h2>AI Model Training Objective </h2>
    <p>Our aim in training an AI model is to: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Identify census data based on postal codes. </li>
      <li>Analyze this data using a risk ruler to assess various financial factors. </li>
      <li>Consolidate all risk ruler scores to determine a comprehensive rating. </li>
      <li>Interpret these ratings to gauge the urgency of implementing community support measures. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Future Model Applications </h2>
    <p>In the future, this model could potentially: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate tailored recommendations and support interventions. </li>
      <li>Leverage news, statistical trends, and additional datasets (e.g., educational institution data, employment records, social media) to address identified risks and improve community outcomes. </li>
    </ul>
